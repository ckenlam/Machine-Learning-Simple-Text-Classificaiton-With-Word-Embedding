# Simple-Text-Classificaiton-With-Word-Embedding

A recent project at my work seeks to explore the possiblity of detecting sales potential in messages from customer support's live chat (i.e binary classification: sales or non-sales potential). Essentially, it is a text classification problem which could be solved by using word embedding. While I did not have sufficient data to conduct such experiment, I still wanted to understand how a pre-trained word embedding model could make training an accurate text classification model possible.


The idea of word embedding is to capture the context of a word in a document, semantic and syntactic similarity, relation with other words. While it doesn't "undestand" the meaning of a word the same way human would, it assigns close spatial positions to words with similar context.
